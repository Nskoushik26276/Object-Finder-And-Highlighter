ðŸ§  Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with OWLâ€‘ViT This project demonstrates open-vocabulary object detection using the OWLâ€‘ViT model from Google. Unlike traditional object detectors limited to fixed classes, OWLâ€‘ViT can detect any object you describe in text, even if it wasnâ€™t seen during training.
